# rendering 
what is rendering 
rendering means react functional yaa class component ko call krenga aur view ko update krega

react components render hote waqt do cheze common hoti hai 
 - phele react saari cheezo ko ikhta krta hai jaise ki props , event handler , state 
 - then unka use krke snapshot create krta hai 
 - aur uss snapshot ka use krke view ko update krta hai 


intial render ke waqt react root element jo ki index.html mein hoti hai woh use krke usme phele root component ko add krta hai 


```
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

const root = createRoot(rootElement);

root.render(<App />);
```

## when does react re render

intresting question 
react tab hee render krta hai jab state change hota hai baaqi kch bhi ho jaye react re render nhi krenga 

### What is batching

react sirf ke baar hee re render krta hai react ka algo aise design hai ki woh ek baar hee render hota hai 

```
const handleClick = () => {

  setCount(1)

  setCount(2)

  setCount(3)

}
```


isme react last wala valid maanega aur uske according state update hoga 


but kya agar hum phele waale yaani 
```
setCount(2)
```
waali state ko use krna chaye toh kaise krenge 
ye bhi kr skte hai ek function pass krke 
```
const handleClick = () => {

  setCount(1)

  setCount(2)

  setCount((c) => c + 3)

}
```
 isme react phele waali state ko use krenga
yaani state update hoga 2+3 = 5


```

const handleClick = () => {

  setCount(1)

  setCount((c) => c + 3)

  setCount(7)

  setCount((c) => c + 10)

}
```
for example iska state output rhenga 7+10 = 17 



#### react update component as well its child component also 

```
import * as React from "react"
import Wave from "./Wave"

function Greeting ({ name }) {
  const [index, setIndex] = React.useState(0)

  const greetings = ['Hello', "Hola", "Bonjour"]

  const handleClick = () => {
    const nextIndex = index === greetings.length - 1
      ? 0
      : index + 1
    setIndex(nextIndex)
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{greetings[index]}, {name}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next Greeting
      </button>
      <Wave />
    </main>
  )
}

export default function App () {
  return <Greeting name="Tyler" />
}
```
 iss waale code mein agar Greeting component hoga then Wave component bhi update hoga

lekin wave component ko update krne ka koi mtlb nhi hai 
toh hum wave component ko React.memo(Wave)
mein use kr skte hai 
Wave componenet re render naa ho

## React memo 

react memo tab hee render krenga jab component ke actually mein props change honge

## Hydration
the server provides the structure (HTML), and the client-side React code adds the behavior (event listeners, state management, etc.). Without hydration, the page would just be static HTML, and your React components wouldn't respond to user interactions. It's necessary because SSR only handles the initial render for faster content delivery and SEO, but the interactivity is still the responsibility of React running in the browser.

## React Fragments

React Fragments are a way to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

**Here's why they're useful:**

- **Avoiding Extra DOM Nodes:** React components must return a single parent element. Without fragments, you might end up adding unnecessary `<div>` elements just to satisfy this requirement, which can clutter your HTML.

- **Semantic HTML:** Sometimes, adding extra `<div>` elements can break your CSS styling or make your HTML less semantically correct.
- **Performance:** Less DOM nodes can lead to slightly better performance, especially in large components.

## Virtual DOM

- **Virtual DOM as a Representation:** The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. Think of it as a blueprint.
- **Diffing Process:** When the state of a component changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it to the previous version. This process is called "diffing."
- **Batch Updates:** React identifies the minimal set of changes needed to update the Real DOM. It then batches these changes together and applies them in a single operation.
- **Real DOM Updates are Expensive:** Directly manipulating the Real DOM is slow because it involves re-rendering the entire page or parts of it. The Virtual DOM allows React to minimize these expensive operations.

**In summary, the Virtual DOM improves performance by:**

- Reducing the number of direct manipulations to the Real DOM.
- Batching updates for efficiency.
- Using efficient diffing algorithms to identify the minimal set of changes.

## **What is the purpose of keys in React lists? Why is it important to use stable and unique keys?**

- **Identifying List Items:** When React renders a list of components, it needs a way to identify each item in the list. Keys provide a unique identifier for each item.
- **Efficient Updates:** When the list changes (e.g., items are added, removed, or reordered), React uses the keys to determine which items have changed, which items need to be updated, and which items need to be removed.
- **Stable Keys:** Stable keys mean that the key for a particular item should not change over time. If the key changes, React will treat the item as a new item and re-render it, even if the underlying data hasn't changed.
- **Unique Keys:** Keys must be unique within the list. If multiple items have the same key, React will have trouble identifying which item is which, and this can lead to unexpected behavior and performance problems.
# components
components are the classes or the functions that can be reused in the entire project anywhere anytime
