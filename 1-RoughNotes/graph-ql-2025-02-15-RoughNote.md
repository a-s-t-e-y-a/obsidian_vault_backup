# Rough Note - 2025-02-15

## Ideas
- [ ] okay how graphql is diff from rest api 
`graph ql gives flexibility that frontend decide what we want `
- [ ] we can solve this problem in REST api also but we have to make new route every time for full fillment of the requirement 
- [ ] okay like if we need name from user and post from blog we can do this in rest by using select and include in prisma but if after some months now user need comments all then we need to update backend
