# Rough Note - 2024-12-27

## Ideas

```
comments are available in the three format in the java 
/*   */                         /// mutiple lines
//                              /// single line
/** */                          /// comments that is part of the java 
```

### [ Widening Conversion] 

``` 
int y = 3;
float x= y;
// called as widening conversion converting int type value into float type int is going to upgrade it self to convert into float
```
 
### [narrowing conversion ]

```
float x=3.4f;
int y = x;
// naroowing down the float to get into int 
```

### [ type casting ]

```
float x=3.4f;
int y = (int)x;
/// called as typecasting
```

```
float k =3.5;
float k = 3.
```
