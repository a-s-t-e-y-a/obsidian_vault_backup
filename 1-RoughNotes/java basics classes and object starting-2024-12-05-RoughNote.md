# Rough Note - 2024-12-05

## abstract keyword

abstract keyword in the java means that this class can have some methods that can have implementation and some cant 

abstract is only used when we have to use that class for inheritance 

abstract can also be used with methods means that method can have only signature in that class they don't need to be implemented 

abstract methods can only be used inside the abstract class  if you define abstract method inside a normal class you'll get the error 

if you don't implement abstract method inside the subclass then you'll get the error
## constructor  or methods 

##### rules to define constructor
 - same  name like class name 
 - no return type { nor int ,void , string , char }
 - constructor can have modifier {private , protected ,public }

## protected vs private 

##### protected 
 -  accessible within the subclass and package
 - use for inheritance 

##### private 
 - Accessible only within the same class.
 - No, not accessible by other classes in the same package.
 - Used for encapsulation, hiding internal details.
