# Rough Note - 2024-12-27

- [ ] every function should be the part of the class
- [ ] you don't have to  put semicolon at the end of the class
- [ ] main class should be of the either public , or none
- [ ] all predefined class in java start with capital letter like { System , String}
- [ ] if we use static before any function we can use that function without calling the instance of that class
- [ ] Strings [] args should be pass every time in main function which is responsible for the getting arguments from the
