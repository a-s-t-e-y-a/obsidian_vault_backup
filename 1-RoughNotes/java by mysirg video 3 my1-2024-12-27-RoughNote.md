# Rough Note - 2024-12-27

## Ideas
- [ ] java is nearly 100% object oriented programming language you cant just use it like c++ by making function
- [ ] every function should be the part of the class
- [ ] you don't have to  put semicolon at the end of the class
- [ ] main class should be of the either public , or none
- [ ] all predefined class in java start with capital letter like { System , String}
- [ ] if we use static before any function we can use that function without calling the instance of that class
- [ ]
